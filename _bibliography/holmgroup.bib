The boundaries considered are a complete catalog of the coincident site lattice boundaries constructible in a computational cell of a prescribed size. Correlations of the boundary energy with other boundary properties (disorientation angle, Σ value, excess boundary volume and proximity of boundary normals to 〈111〉) are examined. None of the usual geometric properties associated with grain boundary energy are useful predictors for this data set. The data set is incorporated as supplementary material to facilitate the search for more complex correlations. The energies of corresponding boundaries in Ni and Al are found to differ by approximately a scaling factor related to the Voigt average shear modulus or C44. Crystallographically close boundaries have similar energies; hence a table of grain boundary energies could be used for interpolation.},

	abstract = {The absolute grain boundary mobility of 388 nickel grain boundaries was calculated using a synthetic driving force molecular dynamics method; complete results appear in the Supplementary materials. Over 25\% of the boundaries, including most of the non-Σ3 highest mobility boundaries, moved by a coupled shear mechanism. The range of non-shearing boundary mobilities is from 40 to 400m/sGPa, except for Σ3 incoherent twins which have mobilities of 200–2000m/sGPa. Some boundaries, including all the 〈111〉 twist boundaries, are immobile within the resolution of the simulation. Boundary mobility is not correlated with scalar parameters such as disorientation angle, Σ value, excess volume or boundary energy. Boundaries less than 15° from each other in five-dimensional crystallographic space tend to have similar mobilities. Some boundaries move via a non-activated motion mechanism, which greatly increases low-temperature mobility. Thermal roughening of grain boundaries is widely observed, with estimated roughening temperatures substantially among boundaries.},

We consider cylindrical island grains in Ni with a [001] tilt axis as a model system. Unexpectedly, we find large variation in the reduced mobility of curved grain boundaries depending on both the imposed constraints and the initial velocity distribution. We perform a dynamic propensity analysis inspired from studies of glass forming liquids to analyze sources of variation in reduced mobility.

The recent development of large materials databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction in particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely leveraged synthetic data enabled by high-quality forward models as well as by generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level overview of deep learning methods followed by a detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging, spectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantification in this field and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods in materials science.},

Nevertheless, extracting unit mechanisms from atomistic simulation data is difficult because of the zoo of competing, geometrically complex 3D atomic rearrangement processes. In this work, we introduce the displacement texture characterization framework for analyzing atomic rearrangement events during GB migration, combining ideas from slip vector analysis, bicrystallography and optimal transportation. Two types of decompositions of displacement data are described: the shear-shuffle and min-shuffle decomposition. The former is used to extract shuffling patterns from shear coupled migration trajectories and the latter is used to analyze temperature dependent shuffling mechanisms. As an application of the displacement texture framework, we characterize the GB geometry dependence of shuffling mechanisms for a crystallographically diverse set of mobile GBs in FCC Ni bicrystals. Two scientific contributions from this analysis include 1) an explanation of the boundary plane dependence of shuffling patterns via metastable GB geometry and 2) a taxonomy of multimodal constrained GB migration mechanisms which may include multiple competing shuffling patterns, period doubling effects, distinct sliding and shear coupling events, and GB self diffusion.},

The traditional trial-and-error method has been unprecedentedly challenged in the modern era when the number of components and phases in novel alloys keeps increasing, with high-entropy alloys as the representative. New opportunities emerge for alloy design in the artificial intelligence era. Here, a successful machine-learning (ML) method has been developed to identify the microstructure images with eye-challenging morphology for a number of martensitic and ferritic steels. Assisted by it, a new neural-network method is proposed for the inverse design of alloys with 20 components, which can accelerate the design process based on microstructure. The method is also readily applied to other material systems given sufficient microstructure images. This work lays the foundation for inverse alloy design based on microstructure images with extremely similar features.},

While deep learning offers new opportunities, an intuition about the required data quality/quantity and a methodological guideline for microstructure quantification is still missing. This, along with deep learning’s seemingly intransparent decision-making process, hampers its breakthrough in this field. We apply a multidisciplinary deep learning approach, devoting equal attention to specimen preparation and imaging, and train distinct U-Net architectures with 30–50 micrographs of different imaging modalities and electron backscatter diffraction-informed annotations. On the challenging task of lath-bainite segmentation in complex-phase steel, we achieve accuracies of 90\% rivaling expert segmentations. Further, we discuss the impact of image context, pre-training with domain-extrinsic data, and data augmentation. Network visualization techniques demonstrate plausible model decisions based on grain boundary morphology.},

	abstract = {Abnormal grain growth can significantly alter the properties of materials during processing. This can cause significant variation in the properties and performance of in-spec feedstock components subjected to identical processing paths. Understanding and controlling abnormal grain growth has proved to be elusive due to the stochastic nature of this phenomenon. However, recent advances in deep learning provide a promising alternative to traditional experimental and physics-based methods for understanding this phenomenon. Neural message passing allows deep learning to be applied to irregular inputs including graph representations of grain structures in a material. In this study we generate a large database of Monte Carlo simulations of abnormal grain growth in an idealized system. We apply message passing neural networks to predict the occurrence of abnormal grain growth in these simulations using only the initial state of the system as input. A computer vision model is also trained for the same task for comparison. The preliminary results indicate that the message passing approach outperforms the computer vision method and achieved 75\% prediction accuracy, significantly better than random guessing. Analysis of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulations provides a road map for ongoing work on this project.},

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is one of the most prominent methods for inclusion analysis.

Prediction models were generated using two different algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), for comparison. For each method, three separate models were developed. Starting with a simple binary model to differentiate between inclusions and non-inclusions, then developing to more complex four and five class models. For the 4-class model, inclusions were split into oxides, sulfides, and oxy-sulfides, in addition to the non-inclusion class. The 5-class model included specific types of inclusions only, namely alumina, calcium aluminates, calcium sulfides, complex calcium-manganese sulfides, and oxy-sulfide inclusions. CNN achieved better accuracy for the binary (92\%) and 4-class (78\%) models, compared to RF (binary 87\%, 4-class 75\%). For the 5-class model, the results were similar, 60\% accuracy for RF and 59\% for CNN.},

After analyzing the results for the labeled data dataset, the trained model was used to generate measurements for a much larger set of unlabeled images.The resulting particle size measurements showed reasonable agreement with laser scattering measurements. The satellite measurements were self-consistent and showed good agreement with the expected trends for different samples.

In this work, we recast the problem of atomic displacement minimization during GB migration as an optimal transport (OT) problem. Under the assumption of a small potential energy barrier for atomic rearrangement, the principle of stationary action applied to GB migration is reduced to the determination of the Wasserstein metric for two point sets. In order to test the minimum distance hypothesis, optimal displacement patterns predicted on the basis of a regularized OT based forward model are compared to molecular dynamics (MD) GB migration data for a variety of GB types and temperatures. Limits of applicability of the minimum distance hypothesis and interesting consequences of the OT formulation are discussed in the context of MD data analysis for twist GBs, general Σ3 twin boundaries and a tilt GB that exhibits shear coupling. The forward model may be used to predict atomic displacement patterns for arbitrary disconnection modes and a variety of metastable states, facilitating the analysis of multimodal GB migration data.},

	abstract = {To obtain high-quality homogeneous photonic glass-based structural color films over large areas, it is essential to precisely control the degree of disorder of the spherical particles used and reduce the crack density within the films as much as possible. To tailor the disorder and quality of photonic glasses, a heteroaggregation-based process was developed by employing two oppositely charged equal-sized polystyrene (PS) particle types. The influence of the particle size ratio on the extent of heteroaggregation in the suspension mixes is investigated and correlated with both the morphology and the resultant optical properties of the films. The results show that the oppositely charged particle size ratio within the mix greatly influences the assembled structure in the films, affecting their roughness, crack density, and the coffee-ring formation. To better differentiate the morphology of the films, scanning electron microscopy images of the microstructures were classified by a supervised training of a deep convolutional neural network model to find distinctions that are inaccessible by conventional image analysis methods. Selected compositions were then infiltrated with TiO2 via atomic layer deposition, and after removal of the PS spheres, surface-templated inverse photonic glasses were obtained. Different color impressions and optical properties were obtained depending on the heteroaggregation level and thus the quality of the resultant films. The best results regarding the stability of the films and suppression of coffee-ring formation are obtained with a 35 wt \% positively charged over negatively charged particle mix, which yielded enhanced structural coloration associated with improved film quality, tailored by the heteroaggregation fabrication process.},

It is found that there is no universal dependence of the shear coupling behavior on temperature or driving force among the grain boundaries being surveyed, i.e., an increase in temperature or driving force may make the shear coupling factor increase, decrease, or remain unchanged depending on grain boundary type. Furthermore, a continuous change in driving force is shown to generate complex shear coupling behaviors in both FCC Ni and BCC Fe bicrystals at each temperature. Observed behaviors include both smooth changes and sharp transitions in shear coupling factor within increasing driving force. Despite this complex behavior, it is found that there is no fundamental difference in the shear coupling behavior between FCC Ni and BCC Fe grain boundaries: (1) all types of transitions in shear coupling behavior that are observed in FCC Ni are also found in BCC Fe; (2) the grain boundaries with low Σ values (e.g., Σ3−Σ11) in both Ni and Fe generally show small or zero shear coupling except for a few special grain boundaries with high symmetry.

	abstract = {Using a large-scale, experimentally captured 3D microstructure data set, we implement the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to learn and generate 3D microstructures of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes.The generated microstructures are visually, statistically, and topologically realistic, with distributions of microstructural parameters, including volume fraction, particle size, surface area, tortuosity, and triple-phase boundary density, being highly similar to those of the original microstructure.These results are compared and contrasted with those from an established, grain-based generation algorithm (DREAM.3D). Importantly, simulations of electrochemical performance, using a locally resolved finite element model, demonstrate that the GAN-generated microstructures closely match the performance distribution of the original, while DREAM.3D leads to significant differences. The ability of the generative machine learning model to recreate microstructures with high fidelity suggests that the essence of complex microstructures may be captured and represented in a compact and manipulatable form.},

	abstract = {Microstructural characterization and analysis is the foundation of microstructural science, connecting materials structure to composition, process history, and properties. Microstructural quantification traditionally involves a human deciding what to measure and then devising a method for doing so. However, recent advances in computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) offer new approaches for extracting information from microstructural images. This overview surveys CV methods for numerically encoding the visual information contained in a microstructural image using either feature-based representations or convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, which then provides input to supervised or unsupervised ML algorithms that find associations and trends in the high-dimensional image representation. CV/ML systems for microstructural characterization and analysis span the taxonomy of image analysis tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. These tools enable new approaches to microstructural analysis, including the development of new, rich visual metrics and the discovery of processing-microstructure-property relationships.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of grain boundary data in materials science from both experiments and simulations, tools are needed to explore the five dimensional space of grain boundaries and visualize and fit structure property relationships along arbitrary paths through this space. In this work, we leverage a recently developed geodesic metric for grain boundaries to visualize the global geometry of grain boundary datasets and fit grain boundary energy to macroscopic grain boundary geometry. It is found that the 5D connectivity of the 388 grain boundary Olmsted dataset can be visualized via dimensionality reduction in 3D with a high degree of interpretability. Furthermore, after selectively adding new grain boundaries to the dataset, these visualizations suggest new global features of grain boundary space, including the existence of a grain boundary fundamental zone with well defined subsets of high symmetry boundaries along faces. Geodesic sampling is shown to be an effective tool to extend grain boundary datasets to new regions of the 5D space. Finally, a simple grain boundary energy kernel regression model with only one fitting parameter is demonstrated to predict grain boundary energy in the Olmsted dataset to within 10\% RMSE.},

	abstract = {In this work, we seek to explain grain boundary motion as a dissipative process within a thermodynamic framework inspired by continuum models for crystal plasticity. This allows for a unified explanation of phenomena such as motion by driving force, shear coupling, mode switching, and stagnation. We begin with a discussion of the kinematic requirements for grain boundary motion and the compatibility of grain boundary shear transformations. The model is based on the principal of minimum dissipation potential, where the “dual dissipation potential” is the energy loss per unit transformed volume as a result of interface motion. Several analytical examples are shown to demonstrate that this model consistently recovers multiple types of grain boundary migration behavior, indicating that the dissipation potential is an intrinsic grain boundary property. It is also shown that the model predicts the phenomenon of mode-switching, and that a “yield surface” can be constructed to relate mechanical loading to mode selection and yield. Molecular dynamics is then used to measure dissipation potential values (in particular the “dissipation energy”) for a wide number of boundaries. Rate-independent dissipation energies are determined for a crystallographically diverse set of 112 Ni grain boundaries using atomistic simulations with two distinct types of physical driving forces: an applied stress and energy jump. Agreement of dissipation energies across driving forces provides verification for the framework. The model’s simplification of migration mechanisms provides a basis for unifying the observed varied grain boundary migration behavior subject to crystallography, driving force, and boundary conditions. Eventually, this framework can be used to develop experimentally calibrated models of grain boundary migration at the mesoscale.},

Single-phase polycrystalline metals undergoing severe plastic deformation develop steady-state textures that are characteristic of the mode of deformation. By contrast, we show that two-phase, Cu-Nb nano-laminate composites reach a variety of different steady-state textures under a single mode of deformation. Using molecular statics simulations and a novel algorithm for crystal rotation analysis, we observe that the final, steady state texture and interface character in these materials depends on the initial texture of the composite. This finding suggests that the range of bulk Cu-Nb nano-composite textures that may be made by severe plastic deformation is larger than previously demonstrated, with multiple plastically-driven steady states accessible, depending on initial texture. We propose a modification of accumulative roll bonding with highly textured seed layers as a means of accessing different driven steady states in layered composites.},

	abstract = {Synthetic driving force molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to survey grain boundary mobility in three classes of incoherent Σ3 twin boundaries: <112>, <110>, and <111> tilt boundaries. These boundaries are faceted on low energy planes, and step flow boundary motion occurs by glide of the triplets of partial dislocations that comprise the mobile facets. Systematic trends with inclination angle are identified and characterized. Observations of thermally activated, anti-thermal, and athermal motion are explained in terms of the orientation of the Shockley partial dislocations along close-packed and non-close-packed directions. Thermally activated <112> tilt boundaries with \{110\} twin facets are found to have smaller energy barriers to motion than <110> tilt boundaries with \{112\} twin facets. Thermally activated boundaries follow a compensation effect associated with a facet roughening transition. As for all faceting boundaries, system size and driving force must be chosen with care to prevent simulation artifacts.},

We derive a geodesic metric based on the inner product between unit octonions, which themselves consist of pairs of quaternions describing the grain orientations in the reference frame of the grain boundary plane. We show how the metric behaves under the application of a number of symmetries: grain exchange symmetry; U(1) symmetry around the grain boundary normal; the no-boundary condition; and crystal symmetry. We show that this metric reproduces the Mackenzie distribution in the no-boundary case, and correctly determines the angular distances between grain boundaries with a common normal or misorientation. We provide a graphical representation of the mapping of quaternion pairs onto the octonion unit sphere, and describe a number of practical computations in the Supplementary Material accompanying this paper.},

Many microstructure analysis and characterization tasks have historically been heavy manual workflows, but are ripe for application of modern computer vision techniques. Computer-vision-based microstructure descriptors coupled with data visualization algorithms enable novel ways of interacting and exploring microstructure databases. The classic approach to image texture recognition focuses on descriptive statistics of low-level image features. Local binary pattern descriptors are one of the earliest local descriptors used for scale and rotation invariant texture classification. Multiscale image texture is a natural way to think of microstructure, where the texture encompasses: the spatial distribution of constituents, crystallographic orientations, chemical composition, or similar materials structure or property values. Notably, microstructure classification was among the earliest applications of image texture analysis, along with analysis of aerial and satellite imagery for land-use categorization.},

Random forest based machine learning models predict hotspot formation with an AUC (area under curve) score of 0.82 for the Equal CRSS and 0.81 for the Unequal CRSS cases. The results show how data driven techniques can be utilized to predict hotspots as well as pinpoint the microstructural features causing stress hotspot formation in polycrystalline microstructures.},
